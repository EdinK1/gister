## Usage

1. Install dependencies & package the desktop app (`npm i && npm run package`)
2. Generate a personal access token with `gist` access [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
3. Open the app in `out/` & enter access token

You are all set! Click on the `ðŸ”„` button next to the file you want to sync and select it from the file-browser. To create a new gist, press the `âž•` button on the top right and enter your new gist's description and filename.

## Troubleshooting

### Debian

If you are on a Debian-based Linux distro and unable to build the app using the `package` script, try to install the npm package `electron-installer-debian` and run the npm script `build:deb`. You should now be able to run the app by simply double-clicking the built `.deb` file in `out/`.

## Development

1. Install dependencies (`npm i`)
2. Open dev build (`npm start`)
